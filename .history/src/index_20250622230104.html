          Ari Atoll also known as Alif or Alifu Atoll is one of the natural
          wonders of the Maldives. Being one of the largest atolls in the
          Maldives, it stretches from north to south in the western part of the
          Maldives archipelago in 30 minutes by seaplane from Male airport.
          South Ari Atoll, a Protected Marine Area, remains one of the best
          places in the world to see whale sharks, which are spotted year-round
          on the outer reef, while North Ari Atoll is famous for its hammerhead
          sharks, although these are far more elusive and require deep diving to
          see.
